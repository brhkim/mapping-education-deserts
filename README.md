# Mapping Education Deserts: A Code Repository
A companion repository of code for the paper The Last Mile in School Access: Mapping Education Deserts in Developing Countries, by Daniel Rodriguez-Segura and Brian Heseung Kim. A working draft of this paper is available here: https://brhkim.com/wp-content/uploads/Education-Deserts-DRBK-21-04-19.pdf

Begin by opening and editing <Code/00_main.R>. This file includes all necessary instructions, documentation, file dependency info, etc. All file specifications, pathing, and analytic decisions are set there explicitly in the first half of the document, with instructions for completing each specification included. We intend to develop this readme in the near future, but please reach out to either of us as questions arise! We hope you find this work useful.
